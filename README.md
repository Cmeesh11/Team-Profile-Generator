# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The team profile generator prompts the user(usually a manager or supervisor) to enter information about their employees. The program will take that information and display it on a nicely formatted webpage that is generated by the program.
Companies that need to visually see information about their employees will find this of use.

## Usage

This requires node.js to be run. Enter "node index.js" in the root directory of the repository to be prompted with a series of questions. The "index.html" and the "style.css" files should be generated in the "dist" directory.
